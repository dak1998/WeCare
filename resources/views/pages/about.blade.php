                Since years in the history of our nation we have witnessed and read in news about wars and battles our country has fought, or indeed our army men and soldiers have. Even with the victory of such wars the nation ends up sacrificing lives of some of our soldiers fighting for the nation. For the same, some civilians wish that they could personally reach out the families of the martyred and help them by some means like donations, apart from the compensations, pensions and allowances granted by the government. But then, there’s always a doubt of how will the transaction take place? even if there’s a way, are there any loopholes in the system? Will the full amount I donated reach the martyr’s family?
	<br><br>Eliminating all these doubts and loopholes, we decided to design a website/web portal where the civilians can browse to, view the details of the martyred and make a donation directly into family’s bank account using the secure online payment gateway. Offering a lot more features than just the donation transaction, like Artificial Intelligence and ChatBot.
